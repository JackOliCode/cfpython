Exercise 2: Data Types in Python<br>

Task:<br>

Create an outer structure (list) that contains a series of <bold>dictionaries</bold>.<br>


I chose dictionaries to store the recipes due to their versatility in handling various data types.<br> 
With strings for names, lists for ingredients, and integers for cooking time, dictionaries offer flexibility and easy updates for future additions to the recipes.<brdec>

I also decided to use a list for the outer structure, as lists are mutable - meaning that the internal elements can be modified, deleted, rearranged and added to.
